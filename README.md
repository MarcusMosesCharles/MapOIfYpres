# About the Game

Mists of Ypres is a first-person 3D horror game set in the haunting trenches and bunkers of World War I. 
As an isolated soldier deep within a fog-choked bunker, you must navigate the darkness, uncover fragments of 
the past, and survive the terror that stalks you—a mysterious cryptid creature born from the chaos of war.

Will you find a way out, or will the mist claim you too?
